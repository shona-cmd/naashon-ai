# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 31, 2026

## Overview

This Privacy Policy explains how the **AI Coding Assistant** extension ("we," "us," "our," or "the extension") handles your data and privacy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Data We Collect

### 1. **Minimal Local Storage**
- **VS Code Settings**: Your API keys and configuration preferences are stored **locally** on your machine in VS Code's settings storage
- **No cloud server**: We do not store your settings, configurations, or API keys on our servers
- **Persistent storage**: Settings are retained between sessions but only on your device

### 2. **Usage Data (Optional)**
The extension does **not** automatically collect usage analytics or telemetry. We do not track:
- Which commands you use
- Which code you generate, explain, or refactor
- How often you use the extension
- Your project structure or files

### 3. **Code Processing**
When you use the extension:
- Your code is sent **directly** to your configured AI provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Your code does **not** pass through our servers
- We have no access to your code or prompts
- The AI provider's privacy policy applies to how they handle your code

## Data We Don't Store

- ❌ Your AI provider API keys (only you store these locally)
- ❌ Your source code or code snippets
- ❌ Your prompts or requests
- ❌ Your usage patterns or activity logs
- ❌ Your personal information beyond what VS Code provides
- ❌ Any generated code or explanations

## Third-Party Services

The extension integrates with AI providers you choose to configure:

### Supported AI Providers
- **OpenAI** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo)
- **Anthropic** (Claude)
- **Google** (Gemini)
- **Other configurable providers**

**Important**: When you use these services:
1. Your code is sent to the AI provider's servers
2. The AI provider's privacy policy governs how they handle your data
3. Review each provider's policy at their respective websites
4. We have no control over how these providers process your data

**Recommended**: Use self-hosted models (e.g., Ollama) to keep all data local.

## How Your Data is Used

### What We Access
- API responses from your configured AI provider (temporary, not stored)
- Error messages for troubleshooting

### What We Don't Do
- ❌ Sell or share your data with third parties
- ❌ Use your code for training or model improvement
- ❌ Profile or analyze your coding habits
- ❌ Store your personal information
- ❌ Track you across the web

## Security

### Local Security
- All API keys are stored in VS Code's secure storage
- Keys are never logged or transmitted unnecessarily
- Use strong, unique API keys for added security

### Transmission Security
- All API calls to AI providers use HTTPS encryption
- No data is stored in temporary files on disk
- Code is sent directly to the provider, not through intermediate servers

## Your Rights

You have full control over:
- **Disabling the extension** at any time
- **Deleting your API keys** and cached data from VS Code settings
- **Choosing your AI provider** or disabling AI features
- **Reviewing your usage** through your AI provider's dashboard

- Changes in our practices
- New features that affect data handling
- Legal or regulatory requirements
